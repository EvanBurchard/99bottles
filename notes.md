* Code changed by who? What is likely? What are the skills of the people
changing the code? Why would they change it?

* Is there a way we can convert code to enable wider participation? (CMS,
localization)

* Is there a desire to rely on storage over algorithmic approaches for
cost reasons?

* Who decides on what is esoteric or expected?

* Shameless Green should be automated by characterization test mode and
copying-pasting.

# Cyclomatic complexity undercounts.

* Type algrebra can give accurate
counts of "how many tests you need" If/case statements are reflected
accurately, but the overall "variety" or "cardinality" in inputs is each parameter's
variety (number of possible inhabitants) multiplied together. |(a, b)| is |a| x |b|.  Also, this
only applies when you don't have implicit or global parameters involved.

* If you want the number of possible implementations, you can look at
  the type of the return statement and use this as the base of an
  exponential expression that puts the params on top.
